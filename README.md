## :scroll: Description
A count down timer from 60. It can start, pause, and reset the timer.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
First time writing a compose app, I'm proud that I was able to to use a ViewModel with livedata
that is used together with Jetpack Compose. I'm also using state for updating the counter.
